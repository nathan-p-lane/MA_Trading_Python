# Moving Average Trading Strategy Analysis
## Introduction
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the implementation and analysis of a simple moving average trading strategy using historical stock price data. The strategy aims to exploit trends in stock prices and make buy/sell decisions based on the relationship between the closing price and the moving average. The moral of the story is, well, I'm just glad I didn't try this with real money.

## Loading and Preprocessing Data
Firstly, I loaded in Johnson & Johnson historical stock data from NASDAQ over a 5 year period using Pandas. Then, I perform various preprocessing steps to clean and format the data. Dates are converted to the datetime format, columns are renamed, and unnecessary characters (dollar signs) are removed from numeric columns. 

## Concluding Remarks
This script demonstrates the implementation and analysis of a moving average trading strategy using historical stock price data. By following the step-by-step process and analyzing the provided visualizations, you can gain insights into how the strategy performs and compare it to a simple buy-and-hold strategy.
